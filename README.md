### KIVA: A Loan That Saves Lives

Kiva is a microlending institution created in 2005, as an experiment by Stanford business school students who were reviewing projects for a microlender in Uganda. Inspired by the work of Dr. Mohammad Yunus, the father of modern microfinance, the experiment evolved to what today we know as the non-profit organization Kiva whose mission is to facilitate access to interest free loans and funding to underbanked and unbanked communities all over the world. 

Traditional lending models require credit history, assets for collateral, citizenship and financial performance verification which the people in these communities do not have preventing them from participating and enjoying the offers of the traditional financial system. By circumventing these limitations and providing financial resources to borrowers in these communities, Kiva’s beneficiaries are able to “*start or grow a business, go to school, access clean energy or realize their potential,*” starting with as little as $25.

Kiva direct competitors in terms of global reach and socio-economic impact are  51Give (China), Al Amana Microfinance, Al-Barakah Microfinance Bank, Annapurna Finance (P) Ltd, Asirvad Microfinance Pvt. Ltd., Banco do Nordeste do Brasil S.A., Bandhan Financial Services Pvt. Ltd., Bank Rakyat Indonesia, BRAC, BSS Microfinance Ltd., Grameen Foundation, Jamii Bora Bank, etc.

Kiva partners with microlenders with a compatible impact-oriented objective and a proven track record. The formal lending processes are mostly automatized, resulting in big cost savings. The loans are funded through a peer to peer, crowdsourcing online platform and donations, and all transactions are executed through PayPal. Through Kiva’s website , the lenders have access to how the resources are being used not only the financial data but also multimedia showing the impact in the lives of loan beneficiaries, the success stories and information on its loan screening processes, the lending risks mitigation processes, providing a level of information accessibility and public transparency unseen with other lenders, traditional or disruptors alike. Kiva also has one of the highest repaid rates, at a rate greater than 97%.

The organization is structured with three impact-first business lines: 

1. Kiva.org, Kiva’s crowdfunding platform which allows individuals to lend as little as $25 (a little goes a long way); 
2. Kiva Protocol, which assists in overcoming two of the major barriers to accessing financial services, the lack of formal identification and of verifiable credit history by conferring a financial digital identity and allowing individuals secure control over their own credit information so that both formal and informal financial institutions (from banks to shopkeepers giving credit, for example) can help contribute to their credit history using distributed ledger technology (DLT); and, 
3. Kiva Capital, the subsidiary that operates as an impact-first asset manager connecting Kiva’s network of local partners with institutional capital, scaling Kiva’s lending ability. The explosion of mobile technology and fintech China, Southeast Asia and Africa, particularly, has increased Kiva’s market capillarity in these regions.

As per stated on its website, Kiva lenders crowdfund an average of $2.5 million in loans each week. 

Looking forward, Kiva aims to continue to harness the power of technology as new developments are available and by partnering with the local authorities, to cater more and more to the needs of the unbanked and underbanked. In their own words: 

>*“One thing that's exciting about technology is that it allows us to really bring out, hopefully, the best of humanity. When you can get involved in someone else's story and invest in someone in West Africa or the Bronx, it's really exciting to be a part of their business journey, you know. And we don't have to feel a sense of pity, but we can feel a sense of excitement and a sense of partnership with someone around the planet.”* – Premal Shah, Kiva Co-Founder 
>
> *“Long-term, our goal is to help achieve full financial inclusion. This starts with creating a more connected and inclusive financial system that empowers all individuals and enterprises to realize their full potential.”* – Brooke Flohr, Bevel Kiva.
